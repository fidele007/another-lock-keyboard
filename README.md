# AnotherLockKeyboard

A variance of system wide lock keyboard that respects the light and dark keyboard. This tweak is heavily inspired by HashBang's LockKeyboard tweak.

This is an archive of the project. I have no plans to continue working on it in the foreseeable future. On the other hand, feel free to fork the project.
